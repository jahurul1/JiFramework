## Framework Philosophy

JiFramework follows a few key design principles:

1. **Simplicity Over Complexity**: We believe that a framework should be intuitive to use without requiring extensive documentation or a steep learning curve.

2. **Flexibility Over Rigidity**: We provide guidelines rather than strict rules, allowing developers to adapt the framework to their specific needs.

3. **Performance Matters**: We optimize our code to ensure that applications built with JiFramework perform well under load.

4. **Security First**: We prioritize secure defaults and provide tools to help developers write secure applications.

## Core Components

JiFramework is built around several core components, each designed to handle specific aspects of web application development:

- **App**: The central container that manages dependencies and configuration.
- **QueryBuilder**: A fluent interface for database operations.
- **Auth**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
- **SessionManager**: Manages secure user sessions.
- **Validator**: Provides data validation capabilities.
- **ErrorPageHandler**: Manages error handling and display.
- **Logger**: Records application events for debugging and monitoring.

In the following sections, we'll explore these components in detail and show you how to use them effectively in your applications.
